Content is replaced everywhere
We cannot use it like “appending to innerHTML
Even if you use +=like “innerHTML = innerHTML + ‘html'” still the old content is replaced by html
The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and builds into elements. Therefore, it’s much slower
The innerHTML does not provide validation, and therefore we can potentially insert valid and broken HTML in the document and break it"

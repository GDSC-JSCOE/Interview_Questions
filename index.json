So, when it comes to log based recovery system, checkpoints come into existence. Checkpoints are those points to which the database engine can recover after a crash as a specified minimal point from where the transaction log record can be used to recover all the committed data up to the point of the crash."

    If you are a programmer, you might have understood the deep meaning of these lines quoted by
    Steve Jobs and you might have also experienced that even after shutting down your computer you keep on thinking 
    about programming stuff or code you have written in your project. Once you enter in programming you just don’t
    learn how to code but you also learn the “art of thinking”, by breaking your code into smaller chunks and then using your 
    logic-based creativity to solve a problem from different angles. Programming is fun, programming is an exercise for your brain, 
    programming is a mental sport and when this sport is held on the
    internet involving sports programmer as a contestant, then it is called Competitive Programming. Check what Wikipedia says about"

Think about a time when you headed up a project, took the initiative to propose an alternate process, or helped motivate your team to get something done. Then use the STAR method to tell your interviewer a story, giving enough detail to paint a picture (but not so much that you start rambling) and making sure you spell out the result.In other words, be clear about why you’re telling this particular story and connect all the dots for the interviewer."
